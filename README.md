# chocomint-principle

ChocoMint is a set of principles for developing high-quality software.

1. Use static analyzers
2. Write unit tests
3. Validate input before the main logic
4. Error messages are educational
5. Containerize the software

We may update the above list in the future.
Please [create a ticket](https://github.com/levelrin/chocomint-principle/issues/new) if you have any question or suggestion.
